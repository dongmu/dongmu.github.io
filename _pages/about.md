I am Chen Cao, an Assistant Professor at The Pennsylvania State University, The Behrend College. Before joining Behrend, I was a post-doctoral researcher in Dr. Peng Liu's cybersecurity lab in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at The Pennsylvania State University.
I received my Ph.D. at the University of China Academy of Sciences (2011-2017) and my bachelor's degree at China University of Mining and Technology (2007-2011).

My research interest is in systems security.
Systems security is a subject which focuses on attack and defense.
To attack a system, the adversary must have the knowledge of weaknesses in the system and exploit them to perform attacks.
To defend a system, the defender has to be aware of weaknesses and protect the system by patching it or adding resilience to the system.
That is to say, the weakness, i.e., vulnerability, is the key role in systems security research.

"If you know both yourself and your enemy, you can win numerous battles without jeopardy."<br/>
<span style="float: right"> -- The Art of War, Sun Tzu </span>
<br/>

In the war between the adversary and the defender, whether knowing vulnerabilities in one system determines whether an attack can be performed or be defeated.
My research philosophy is to grab the key role to protect systems, and goes through a spiral which starts from vulnerability discovery and analysis, dealing with vulnerabilities with novel security design, to a new loop on new systems.

<!-- Over the past years, I have followed this research philosophy and worked on several systems.
I have done vulnerability discovery and vulnerability analysis in Android system.
I also have enhanced IoT (Internet of Things) system and vehicle system with hardware features. -->
